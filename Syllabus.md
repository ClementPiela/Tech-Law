# PROGRAMME AND READING MATERIAL

**SESSION 1 – INTRODUCTORY SESSION: AI AND THE LAW (JANUARY 4, 2021, 2.30 PM)**
This session provides a general overview of the technological transformation underway in our society and economy, its instruments, and its effects on legal processes and the legal profession. It includes a guest talk by Dazza Greenwood (MIT Computational Law) and an open discussion with Prof. David Restrepo Amariles. It will flesh out basic notions of computational law (e.g. internet of things, automation and computation, etc.) and technologies supporting digital transformation (data analytics, symbolic AI, machine learning). Based on several examples, we discuss how technology affects the content of legal norms, their life cycle and their enforcement. Finally, we reflect about the role of law-trained professionals in both engineering and framing the use of these multiple technologies. This session includes an introduction to the use of Github.

**SESSION 2 – LEGAL METRICS AND ANALYTICS FOR LAWYERS (JANUARY 5, 2021, 9.00 AM)**
The first part of this session focuses on legal metrics, including indicators, indexes and analytics. It introduces students to the role of social indicators and statistics in law, and discusses the different types of data collection methods, aggregation methodologies and forms of representing the results. Students will have the opportunities to discuss their case study during the class. The second part of the session will provide students with an overview of current technologies used to automate the extraction of data from legal text and generate legal analytics. We will discuss the use of different sorts of algorithms in legal processes to collect and process data, produce analytics, and automatize decision-making in legal contexts. By looking concretely into the process of implementing data mining techniques to a pre-defined dataset, we will explore the phases of data cleansing, pre-processing, formalization, segmentation, legal design, and ontologies, etc.

**SESSION 3 - AI AND ETHICS – IN COLLABORATION WITH A&O (JANUARY 11, 2021, 2.30 PM)**
The first part of this session is dedicated to the presentation of the preliminary results by each group. You will have 5 minutes to present your ideas. The second part outlines the key data ethics challenges that arise in relation to reliance on machine learning systems. We will focus on the issues of bias, discrimination, explainability, transparency and security of algorithms. The second part of this session will focus on how ethics is a growing concern for businesses and regulators across the world (CNIL report on ethical issues, European Commission draft Ethics Guidelines, the National Health Service’s Code of Conduct for responsible data use by its AI partners).

**SESSION 4 –  AI AND PARTNERSHIP - IN COLLABORATION WITH A&O (JANUARY 12, 2021, 9.00 AM)**
This session addresses the topic of data governance and data monetization. Businesses are increasingly considering how they can harness AI to grow revenues, improve business processes or better exploit their assets, whilst remaining compliant and safe.  AI can also be the reason for deals being done. In the last few years, A&O advised at on a number of AI projects, both transactional and advisory in nature, by which clients are seeking either to acquire AI technology and expertise or develop AI capabilities through transformation projects. 

**OPTIONAL SESSION –MIT COMPUTATIONAL LAW COURSE (JANUARY 15, 2021, 6.00 -7.00PM)**
WITH DAZZA GREENWOOD, Lecturer and Researcher, MIT Connection Science and MIT Media Lab and Executive Director, Law.MIT.edu".

**SESSION 5 – AI AND LEGAL ADVICE LAW - IN COLLABORATION WITH A&O (JANUARY 26, 2021, 9.00 AM)**
This session will focus on the background for providing legal advice under the relevant bar rules and their interaction with technology and AI. There are obvious limits to what formulaic and logical programmes can achieve without a lawyer intervention. The objective would be to identify and address the issues relating to the use of AI in providing legal advice including through attorney-client privilege and legal opinions.

**SESSION 6 – REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS FOR AI LAW (JANUARY 28, 2021, 9.00 AM)**
This session looks into the multiple regulatory initiatives from the public and private sector to frame the use of AI. More particularly, it sketches out the risk approach and the sociological background supporting most of current approaches to AI regulation. It also highlights generally strategies to hold algorithms accountable from an IT (auditing, statistic and dynamic testing, circuit breakers, scalability, etc.) and managerial perspective (ethics codes, CSR, etc.). The second, part of this session is dedicated to a Q&A related to the case study. Students can test their final hypothesis and discuss with the course instructor the preparatory work for the presentation of the results.
